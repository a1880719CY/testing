1. The complexity of the given code fragment can be described as O(n), where 'n' is the value controlling the loop. The loop iterates 'n / 4' times, which still grows linearly with 'n'.

2.The tightest complexity that describes the given code fragment is O(n), as the loop iterates 'n / 4' times, which still grows linearly with 'n'.
